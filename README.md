# Utrecht University NLP Group Meeting

Repository for hosting UU NLP group meeting materials. 

In the folder for each semester we host the slides and other meeting materials. 

An unofficial UU-themed presentation template is available if you want to create slides using LaTeX. For Powerpoint/LibreOffice and Apple Keynote there is an [official template available](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/corporate-identity/downloads/powerpoint-keynote) at the university website. Of course using any other template (or not using slides at all) is perfectly fine as well.
